# smallpics
a small thing bc i'm too lazy to resize all my drawings fro displaying online

images in the folder 'large' will get resized to 1200px width and output to the folder 'resized'

### instructions:
move images you want to resize to the folder 'large'
run resize.py to resize images
if the image has already been resized and exists in the folder 'resized' it will be skipped over
