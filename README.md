a small thing bc i'm too lazy to resize all my drawings fro displaying online

images in the folder 'large' will get resized to 1200px width and output to the folder 'resized'

### instructions:
* move images you want to resize to the folder 'large'
* run resize.py to resize images
* the program defaults to saving your image as jpg -- if you want to change the file format enter it as the 1st argument
* the default width is 1200, if you want to change that, enter it as the second argument
* example: python resize.py png 1000
* if the image has already been resized and exists in the folder 'resized' it will be skipped over
